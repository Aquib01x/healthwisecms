# Frontend Overview


This repo showcases a secure and research-backed content management system to allow physical activity health researchers to develop and publish mobile
applications adhering to the various stages of the Transtheoretical Model of Behaviour Change. 

This application comes in the form of a web app. Without requiring any technical knowledge of mobile app development, physical activity health researchers can view and utilize an app-builder interface to import pre-built components such as stage-based surveys, write educational content, and track participant usage. They are also to deploy their apps effortlessly by sending emails to potential users or by simply scanning QR codes containing the URLs for the mobile apps.

Here are some screenshots of the finished application:
